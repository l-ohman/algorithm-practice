// first time creating / working with heaps.
// note: heap should be represented with an array.

// a binary heap is a 'special' type of binary tree.
// must be COMPLETE, except for last row. when adding, add from left to right.
// heap property: every node is less than the value of its children in a min heap (max heap is opposite).
// heaps are NOT sorted. the most important property is accessing the ROOT node (smallest/largest).
//             8
//         /       \
//       12         23
//     /    \     /    \
//    17    31   30    44
//   /  \
//  22  18
// can be represented as conventional arrays, interestingly enough â€” using indicies.
// to get child 1 node => 2i + 1 // 14
// to get child 2 node => 2i + 2
// to get parent node => (i - 1)/2 (rounded down)
// array of the above heap: [8, 12, 23, 17, 31, 30, 44, 22, 18]
