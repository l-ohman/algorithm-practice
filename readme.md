# Algorithm practice

Repo to practice solving algos and writing unit tests.

These problems are a mix from various algorithm-practice sites, such as AlgoExpert, Leetcode, etc.

## Progress

<!-- "Attempted" represents every problem I have tried to solve; "Solved" means I was able to pass all tests without any external assistance or research. -->
<!-- There is a "+" on 'Hard' because some sites have a 'Very Hard' category -->
