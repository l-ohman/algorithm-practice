# Algorithm practice

Repo to practice solving algos and writing unit tests.
<!-- These problems are a mix from various algorithm-practice sites, such as AlgoExpert, Leetcode, etc. -->

<!-- todo: display the json data in some online visualization (probably with github pages) -->
<!-- todo: add specific commands for testing difficulties -->

## Progress

<!-- On sites where 'Very Hard' is not a difficulty, I have added problems with a <35% success rate -->
