# Algorithm practice

Repo to practice solving algos and writing unit tests.

These problems are a mix from various algorithm-practice sites, such as AlgoExpert, Leetcode, etc.

<!-- todo: display the json data in some online visualization (probably with github pages)-->
<!-- todo: add specific commands for testing difficulties -->

## Progress
